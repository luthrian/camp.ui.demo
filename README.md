#Camp.UI.Demo 
This is a demo application using Vaadin for the Web-"UI".
It was conceived mainly as a means to demonstrate a few features of the Camsolute Process Management Framework (CAMP).
This is achieved using the [](https://github.com/luthrian/camp.lib "camp.lib") and [](http://www.github.com/luthrian/camp.api "camp.api") modules together with the [](https://github.com/luthrian/camp.engine "camp.engine") camunda process-application starter template.
The web-application was based on examples from Vaadin's starter template available at their [](http://www.vaading.com "website")
